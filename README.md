This work shows empirical results of investigations of the algorithms A2C and Deep Q applied to a real stock trading problem in order to answer the questions what drives the results and how can the algorithms be adjusted. The results were deriven whether of a for loop with 10 runs and 5 training runs each or they are derived upon a typical run.

The write up is arranged in "Use Cases" with exemplary "Show Cases" and is structured as follows. The first section compromises the findings in so called "Base Case" which show how sensitive the algorithms are against the (hyper)parameter and variable setting. While the "Special Cases" show how the agent performs under stress testing, such as increased volatility or different distributions of the training and the test data set.
